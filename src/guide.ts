/**
 * The guide: guidance instead of documentation.
 *
 * Segreant's journey is five verifiable facts — traffic flows, a cap exists,
 * an outcome landed, value computed, dollars disclosed. This module reads those
 * facts (gathered by the caller from the store + config, never from what the
 * user says they did) and returns the whole journey with done-flags plus the
 * single next action. The CLI and the dashboard render the same report, so the
 * user is never told two different "next steps".
 *
 * Pure: facts in, report out. No I/O here — that keeps it testable to the line.
