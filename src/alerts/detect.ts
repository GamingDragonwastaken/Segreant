/**
 * Proactive governance — turning passive measurement into alerts.
 *
 * A spend-governance tool that only blocks (silently) is half a product: the
 * user finds out something went wrong by noticing their agent stalled, or by
 * reading a dashboard they happened to open. This detects the conditions worth
 * surfacing — budget pressure, spend spikes, runaway loops, throttling, value
 * craters, untrustworthy pricing — from data already on the device. No external
 * services, no notifications leaving the machine.
 *
 * `detectAlerts` is pure over precomputed inputs (testable without a store);
 * `computeAlerts` is the store-backed wrapper the CLI and dashboard call.

 * finding: `segreant ops` printed a green "all clear". Two different situations
 * produce that empty array. In one, six detectors examined real traffic and none
 * tripped. In the other, the detectors were structurally unable to fire, and the
 * empty array records that nothing was looked at.
 *
 * The default install is the second case, which makes it the common one. Caps
 * are opt-in, so every threshold starts null; a fresh ledger has no prior active
 * day, so the spike baseline is zero and its detector requires `base > 0`; value
 * is uninstrumented until units mature. On that install not one of the six
 * channels can produce an alert, and the operator was shown a green tick.
 *
 * This is `assessCompleteness` one module over: absence is a negative claim only
 * where there is positive evidence the source could have seen the thing. So the
 * surface states coverage, and a dark channel names the setting that would light
 * it rather than merely reporting itself unavailable.
