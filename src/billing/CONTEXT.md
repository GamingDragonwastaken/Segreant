# billing — provider-side evidence and reconciliation

<!-- Layer 2 contract. The boundary between what we measured and what a provider billed. -->

## Consumes

- `src/store/db.ts` for observation runs, imports, and the request ledger.
- Operator-declared route scope (`scope.ts`) — a self-assertion, never verified.
- Either an authorized OpenAI Costs pull (`openaiCosts.ts`) or an
  operator-supplied export adopted from an import (`Store.adoptOpenAiCostsFromImport`).
- Exact imported-record mapping (`mapping.ts`) can attach a provider line to a
  local project/account, but only as an operator declaration.
- `epistemic.ts` issues the first vertical's provider-line Evidence and billed
  Claims through exact `Money`, and can issue a mixed-basis reconciliation Claim
  when both provider and local-capture evidence IDs are supplied. Complete
  direct OpenAI Costs snapshots issue separate provider-observed Evidence and
  Claims; they never become billed merely because the endpoint is authoritative.
  A recorded reconciliation can persist the provider, local-capture and mixed
  residual Claims as one resumable kernel issuance; CLI `--apply` uses that path.

## Guarantees

- Reconciliation compares at **project-day total** grain — the only compatible
  join, because provider line items map to neither models nor requests.
- Status is `reconciled_with_residual`, **never** `reconciled`. The residual is
  an upper bound on off-path spend, not a measurement.
- Every run carries `providerSourceKind` (`provider_api_pull` /
  `operator_supplied_export` / `legacy_unknown`) and its conditions. The
  operator-supplied route adds a fifth condition and is never presented as
  equivalent evidence to a pull.
- A residual whose period lost request rows to retention **classifies nothing**.
  Deletion understates the local total by an unknown amount, so an upper bound
  on off-path spend is not established — while a NEGATIVE residual keeps its
  refutation, because truncation can only hide one and never invent one. The
  boundary travels into the reconciliation separately from the rows, because a
  reader of rows cannot see the ones that are gone.
- Refuses rather than softens: a period ending within 48h, non-USD or mixed
  currency, non-whole-UTC-day input, and out-of-project records are refused with
  the excluded money reported.
- Mapping coverage is explicit: each imported line is `mapped_operator_declared`,
  `unmapped`, `stale_mapping`, or `ambiguous_mapping`; residual dollars remain
  visible and are never force-fitted.
- Kernel issuance keeps provider billed amounts and local estimated amounts as
  separate Money bases; a residual is a typed comparison, never a new basis or
  an attributable cause. Repeating issuance is idempotent through the kernel
  ledger.

## Invariants

- **Never create, request, store, or transmit a provider credential.** Previews
  make no network request and read no credential; both facts are asserted in the
  release gate.
- **A reconciled amount never reaches budgets, RoI, or model recommendations.**
- **A mapped imported amount never reaches budgets, RoI, or model recommendations
  while provider scope is operator-declared.** Mapping is versioned evidence, not
  provider verification; only a future explicit provider-verified authority can
  discharge this gate.
- `isOnDeclaredRoute` counts only `provider === 'openai' && via === 'proxy'`
  carrying the declared scope id. **Imported rows are excluded and must stay
  excluded** — an imported row has the model and the cost but nothing tying it to
  the declared provider project. Counting it would invent the attribution this
  module exists to refuse. On a maintainer's real ledger this excludes 100% of
  OpenAI spend, which is why readiness reports coverage *before* the credential
  step.
