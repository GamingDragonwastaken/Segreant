/**
 * Provider reconciliation at the only grain that joins.
 *
 * `openaiCostsCoverage.ts` partitions the local ledger against a provider
 * snapshot and then refuses to compare them, listing five blockers. Three of
 * those five are not blockers to reconciliation — they are blockers to a
 * PER-REQUEST reconciliation, which nobody should attempt:
 *
 *   - `provider_line_items_do_not_join_to_requests_or_models` — true, and the
 *     reason this module compares project-DAY TOTALS. A line item is not a
 *     model and never will be; summing a day's line items and comparing that
 *     one number is a compatible join, not a lossy one.
 *   - `local_request_amounts_are_rate_card_estimates` — true, and it is the
 *     SUBJECT of the comparison rather than an obstacle to it. The gap between
 *     a list-price estimate and a provider report is the thing being measured.
 *   - `provider_finality_is_undocumented` — true of any single snapshot, which
 *     is why a run records whether independent snapshots of the same period
 *     agree. That is observed stability, never provider-attested finality.
 *
 * Two survive as permanent CONDITIONS on every result, and are carried on the
 * record rather than resolved:
 *
 *   - `local_route_scope_is_not_provider_verified` — the operator declared that
 *     traffic to one endpoint belongs to one project. Nothing here proves it.
 *     Every number below is conditional on that declaration being true.
 *   - `off_path_provider_usage_is_not_observable` — usage that never passed
 *     through Segreant cannot be seen, only inferred from the residual.
 *
 * So the output is never `reconciled`. It is `reconciled_with_residual`: a
 * variance, per day, with a structural reason, under stated conditions. A
 * number that agreed exactly would be more suspicious than one that did not.
 *
 * Pure and store-free so it can be tested against fixtures without a database
 * and without a provider credential.

/**
 * What a residual can and cannot say about spend that never passed through

 *
 * Write P for the provider's reported total on the declared scope, L for what
 * Segreant metered on it, T for the true billed cost of the traffic that DID pass
 * through, and O for the true billed cost of the traffic that did not. The
 * provider bills both, so P = T + O, and the residual is
 *
 *   R = P - L = O + (T - L)
 *
 * Therefore `O <= R` holds exactly when `L <= T`: when the local rate-card
 * ESTIMATE does not exceed the true billed cost of on-path traffic. That is a
 * condition, not a fact, and it is the reason a residual is an upper bound
 * rather than a measurement.
 *
 * R < 0 is the interesting case. It says L > P = T + O >= T, which REFUTES the
 * condition outright: the local estimate exceeds everything the provider billed
 * on this scope. No upper bound on off-path spend survives, because local
 * over-estimation has absorbed an unknown amount of it. Reporting "unexplained:
 * -$3.10" and letting a reader conclude that nothing went off-path is inferring
 * absence from an observation that specifically undermines the inference.
 *
 * RETENTION BREAKS THE ONE QUANTITY THIS CAN OBSERVE, AND ONLY IN ONE DIRECTION
 * (D-173). `segreant prune` deletes request rows on the operator's own policy. It
 * changes neither P, T nor O — it changes what can be COMPUTED for L. The
 * surviving ledger yields `L' = L - D` for a deleted on-path amount `D >= 0`
 * that no surviving row records, so the computed residual is `R' = R + D`.
 *
 *   A REFUTATION SURVIVES IT. `R' < 0` implies `R = R' - D <= R' < 0`, so a
 *   negative residual still establishes `L > T`. Truncation can only HIDE a
 *   refutation, never manufacture one, and discarding a sound conclusion
 *   because the ledger was pruned would be caution that costs information.
 *
 *   AN UPPER BOUND DOES NOT. `R' >= 0` says nothing about the sign of R,
 *   because D is unknown. So the bound is not established, and reporting it is
 *   an absence produced by deletion read as an absence of events — the exact
 *   inference this type exists to refuse.
 *
 * Measured before it was written down: a provider total of $10.00 against two
 * metered days of $6.00 gave `-$2.00` and `none_local_estimate_exceeds_provider`;
 * deleting the first day gave `+$4.00` and `upper_bound_conditional`, with
