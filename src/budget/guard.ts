/**
 * Budget enforcement.
 *
 * Honest scope: a proxy cannot know a request's final cost before it runs (the
 * output token count is unknown until the model answers). So the guard enforces
 * what it genuinely can:
 *   1. Hard daily cap  — block once today's spend is already at/over the cap.
 *   2. Hard session cap — block once a session's spend is already at/over.
 *   3. Runaway velocity — block when spend inside a short sliding window spikes,
 *      which is the signature of an agent stuck in an unattended loop.
 *   4. Soft daily threshold — allow, but flag a warning the proxy surfaces in a
 *      response header so the developer sees it without being interrupted.
 *
 * Caps are opt-in (null = off) so the default install never blocks anything.
