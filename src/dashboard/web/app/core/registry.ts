 * promise in a README. Every CLI capability is listed here with its territory,
 * its consequence, and its honest GUI status. The Settings surface renders this
 * table, so a gap is visible to the operator instead of discovered by them.
 *
 * Adding a CLI verb without adding its row is the one change this file exists to
 * make awkward -- and until D-167 it was not awkward at all, because nothing
 * compared this list with `src/cli.ts`'s dispatch. Six commands had no row and
 * the parity denominator did not count them.
 * `test/dashboard-parity-population.test.ts` enforces the rule this paragraph
 * has always stated.
