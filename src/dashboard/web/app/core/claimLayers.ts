/**
 * Renders the four claims, and their evidence, from the live payloads.
 *
 * The rule this module exists to enforce: a layer reports what is missing and
 * what would close the gap, because the most useful thing this product can tell
 * an operator is where their evidence stops.
 *
 * WHAT MOVED (AII-014). The support AXES are no longer derived here. Each
 * payload now carries its own `claimSupport`, stated by the side that holds the
 * evidence — see `src/dashboard/claim-support.ts` for why, and for the three
 * defects that inferring them in the browser produced. What remains here is the
 * PROSE: the one-line basis, the next step, and the six inspection dimensions,
 * which belong next to the pixels that show them. Where the server attaches a
 * `note`, this module renders it rather than restating the axes in its own
 * words — two descriptions of one judgement is how they come apart.
 *
 * The one judgement still made here is what a claim's support is when its
 * endpoint did not answer. A server cannot state that about a payload it never
 * sent.
 *
 * This is a PURE function of four payloads. The fetching lives in `chain.ts`,
 * which is the half that can fail per-endpoint; the split exists so that the
 * derivation — which is where the product's claims are actually made, and so
 * where a mistake is most expensive — can be tested against fixtures with no
 * server, no sockets, and no ledger. Every `null` input here means "that
 * endpoint did not answer", and each layer degrades on its own.
