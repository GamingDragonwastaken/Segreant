/**
 * The shape of a claim, and the shape of its evidence.
 *
 * These types live in `core/` rather than beside the spine that renders them,
 * because two independent things need them and neither should have to reach
 * into a component to get one: `core/claimLayers.ts` derives them from the
 * payloads, and `components/claimInspector.ts` displays them. A core module
 * importing a component to borrow a type is a layering inversion that only ever
 * gets worse, so the type lives below both. `components/spine.ts` re-exports
 * them, so nothing that already imported `Layer` from there had to change.
 *
 * `ClaimInspection` is the part worth explaining. This product's whole position
 * is that a figure which cannot say where it came from should not ship — and a
 * band reading "$89.66 · counted from requests" states a basis in six words,
 * which is enough to orient and not enough to audit. The inspection is the
 * audit: the same claim answered along the six dimensions that decide whether
 * an operator can actually rely on it, plus what it is assuming and what
 * evidence it does not have. Every field is REQUIRED and every field is a
 * string, so there is no such thing as a claim that declines to answer one of
 * them. Where a dimension is not established, the honest string says so —
 * "not established", "no reconciled provider scope" — because a blank renders
 * identically to a dimension nobody thought about.
