/**
 * The ledger spine — the primary structure of this GUI, and its thesis.
 *
 *     metered usage != provider-billed cost != allocated cost != realized value
 *
 * Four claims, four evidence standards, and the one idea this product owns. Every
 * other spend tool collapses them into a single confident number; Segreant refuses
 * to, so the interface should not bury that refusal in a caption under a stat
 * card. It IS the layout.
 *
 * The spine renders the four layers side by side, separated by the inequality
 * itself. Each is established or not on its OWN evidence — reconciliation for
 * billed, recorded rules for allocated, matured outcomes for realized — and an
 * unestablished layer reads "not established", never zero. A zero is a
 * measurement; an absence is not, and they must not look alike.
 *
 * This is also the navigation: the four layers are where the money questions
 * live, so selecting a band is selecting a view.
