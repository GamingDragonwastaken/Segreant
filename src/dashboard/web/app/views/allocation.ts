/**
 * Allocation — whose budget the money lands on, and what that number is not.
 *
 * Allocated cost is the third claim in the spine, and the one most often
 * mistaken for the first. It is a DERIVED split of local estimates: a rule said
 * this request belongs to that cost centre. It is not a provider bill, it is not
 * what anyone owes, and it is explicitly excluded from budget enforcement, RoI,
 * and model recommendations — because a showback split is not evidence about
 * value or about money actually charged.
 *
 * So this view leads with the exclusions, not with a total. The payload states
 * its own basis (`showback_only`) and the list of things it must not feed; that
 * list is rendered as the first thing on the page rather than as a footnote,
 * because a reader who takes an allocation figure into a budget conversation has
 * already made the mistake the label exists to prevent.
