/**
 * ISSUANCE CLASS: display_only — see `src/epistemic/issuance-map.ts`. This
 * states, on named axes, what the payload-building code already knows about its
 * own evidence. It issues nothing and must never be the first place a stronger
 * claim appears; where it cannot tell, it says `unknown`.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SERVER-SIDE (AII-014, WP-B02's remainder).
 *
 * WP-B02 gave the GUI four named support axes in place of one
 * `established: boolean`. It did not move the JUDGEMENT: the browser went on
 * inferring the axes from whatever collapsed field the payload happened to
 * carry — a count of runs, a share of estimated spend, whether a ratio said
 * `usd`. The axes reached the projection and not the wire, and the server, which
 * holds the evidence, said nothing at all about its own claims.
 *
 * Three consequences, each found by reading the payload against the derivation
 * rather than by reasoning about it:
 *
 *   THE INFERENCE COULD NOT REACH `conflicted`. Every browser derivation was a
 *   two-branch ternary over a count. A reconciliation whose provider snapshots
 *   changed between observations — `changed_across_observations`, disclosed by
 *   `reconcileOpenAiCosts` and printed by the CLI — rendered on the spine
 *   exactly like one whose snapshots agreed. The field was on the wire and
 *   undeclared, so the browser could not have read it if it had wanted to.
 *
 *   AN EMPTY LEDGER REPORTED COMPLETE PRICING COVERAGE. `estimatedSpendShare`
 *   is 0 when there is no spend to price, so `share > 0 ? partial : complete`
 *   answered `complete` for a window with nothing in it. A completeness claim
 *   with no evidence behind it is the defect D-067 and D-069 exist to refuse,
 *   one axis over.
 *
 *   NOTHING BUT THE BROWSER GOT AN ANSWER. The CLI, a script, anything reading
 *   `/api/*` had to repeat the guesswork with nothing holding the two versions
 *   in agreement.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not decide whether the
 * endpoint answered. A server cannot state the support of a payload it never
 * sent, so "unreachable" stays a browser-side fact, and `core/claimLayers.ts`
 * supplies it. Nor does it write the operator-facing prose: the basis line, the
 * next step and the inspection stay where they can be read next to the pixels.
 *
 * A POPULATION OF CONTRADICTIONS IS NOT A CONTRADICTION IN THE AGGREGATE. This
 * distinction decides two of the four claims below and is worth stating once.
 * `informationJoin` combines two observations OF ONE PROPOSITION: the provider
 * said $8 for Tuesday and later said $10, so the claim about Tuesday is
 * `conflicted`. Twelve mature units whose gate evidence contradicted itself is
 * not that. Those are twelve different propositions, and joining them would
 * paint the aggregate with a state none of its parts asserts about it. The
 * honest reading is that the aggregate is SUPPORTED by the units that
 * adjudicated and does not REACH the ones that did not — coverage, not
 * epistemic state. So billing conflict lands on `epistemic` and realization
 * conflict lands on `coverage`, and the difference is the point rather than an
 * inconsistency.

/**
 * The seven axes that do not vary, and why stating them is the point.

 * assertion rather than a provider-authenticated one, a scope conditional on
 * this ledger, a measurement model never validated against a provider
 * statement, no causal identification, nothing final, and no decision-fitness
 * assessment. The dashboard's claims are those same claims, so they carry the
 * same values.
 *
 * Constancy is the reason to SEND them, not a reason to omit them. An operator
 * reading a cost spine has no way to discover from four varying axes that no
 * figure on the page is causal or final, and those are the two things a FinOps
 * reader most reliably assumes. The moment one of them does vary -- the causal
