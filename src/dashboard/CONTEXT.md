# dashboard — the web GUI and its local server

<!-- Layer 2 contract. This is a GUI for operating Segreant, not a read-only dashboard. -->

## Consumes

- `src/store/db.ts` (read, and write on the mutating routes), `src/config.ts`.
- The value, billing, alloc and cost modules for computed payloads.
- `src/dashboard/shared-types.ts` for the canonical no-runtime payload declarations;
  the build emits a hash-bound browser copy under `web/app/core/generated-types.ts`.
- Nothing from the network. Not at build time, not at run time.

## Layout

```
server.ts            entry + guards: loopback Host, route matching, method/CSRF
routes.ts            one named handler per endpoint, plus the ROUTES table
value-cache.ts       in-memory /api/value payload cache (per Store, 8 entries, 10 min TTL,
                     keyed on query, repo HEAD, config hash and ledger change marks).
                     Memory only: it never persists a realization.
static.ts            asset serving and the two HTML entry points
settings.ts          settings snapshot / patch
web/
  index.html         the GUI shell. Carries the DIRECTION CONTRACT comment.
  classic.html       the previous single-file dashboard, served at /classic
  styles/app.css     the Night Vault design system
  app/
    tsconfig.json    its own compiler config: DOM lib, no node types
    main.ts          shell, rail, routing, first-run register choice
    core/
      signal.ts      reactive primitive (~80 lines, no framework)
      dom.ts         h() / render(); no HTML-parsing sink anywhere
      fmt.ts         money, dates, and the plain/precise REGISTER
      api.ts         typed client for this server; consumes generated-types.ts
      generated-types.ts  generated browser copy of shared-types.ts; never edit
      claimTypes.ts  Layer + ClaimInspection: the shape of a claim's evidence
      claimLayers.ts the four claims, DERIVED from payloads. Pure; tested.
      chain.ts       the I/O half: four independent reads, each degrading alone
      registry.ts    THE PARITY MAP — every capability, tier, coverage
      actions.ts     preview/commit builders per capability
    components/
      spine.ts       the four bands and the ≠ between them
      drawer.ts      the action drawer: preview → consequence → command → commit
      claimInspector.ts  the long form of a band's basis. Reads; never acts.
    views/           one per territory
```

## Guarantees

- **The GUI reaches for CLI parity, and says where it has not.** `registry.ts` is
  the single source for navigation, action cards, and the parity table rendered
  in System. A capability with no screen is visible in the product as unbuilt.
  A row's `coverage` VALUE is checked against the app source, not taken as a
  claim (D-239, `test/dashboard-coverage-value.test.ts`): `full` or `partial`
  needs an action builder keyed by the id, the id in a view, or a `guiEvidence`
  pointer to a file and token the gate reads; rows with no surface may carry
  none. This proves a live binding, not that the screen does the whole job.
- **Progressive disclosure is a decision, and presentation follows the axes
  (D-256, `test/dashboard-progressive-disclosure.test.ts`).** A first-run
  operator sees the plain/precise choice and nothing routes until they choose;
  `plain` rounds every figure and says its basis in words, `precise` states
  the microdollar, the provenance label and the equivalent command; every
  non-`read` consequence is rendered as a styled tag on its action card, and
  the territory axis builds the operations bar and the System table. The
  formatters are tested under both registers; the structural rules are read
  from the shell and view sources.
- **The Claim Inspector has a kernel behind it (D-257,
  `test/dashboard-kernel-viewer.test.ts`).** `GET /api/kernel?node=<id>[&asOf=]`
  serves one epistemic node with its record, the edges into and out of it, the
  derivations and assumptions behind a claim, whether revocation reaches it,
  and how much the ledger held — live, or replayed to `asOf` through the same
  hindsight-safe boundary `/api/billing` uses, so a node not yet available
  answers `found: false` exactly like one that never existed. The Evidence
  view renders it as a reader (pick an issued billing claim or type an id,
  follow an edge, set a boundary) with no action surface. Billing evidence
  payloads are withheld and named by their canonical digest.
- **The test prerequisite is explicit.** `npm test` performs a full build before
  running tests because package-boundary checks inspect both browser and Node
  artifacts in `dist/`. The build script's `--web` mode remains a targeted GUI
  iteration tool, not the ordinary test contract.
- **Nothing happens without a preview.** Every action opens the drawer, which
  states the consequence in words, shows the computed preview, prints the
  equivalent command, and only then offers the commit.
- **Classic is an explicitly legacy compatibility view.** `/classic` preserves
  the earlier single-file dashboard and its direct settings controls; it does
  not provide the modern preview-first action flow and must not be presented as
  GUI parity. The modern `/` surface is the preview/consequence/apply contract.
- **Consequence tiers gate the commit**: `read` has none, `local` needs a loaded
  preview, `credential` and `egress` name what is read or sent, `destructive`
  requires typing the capability id.
- **Two audiences, one screen.** The `register` signal switches wording and
  precision, never the data. `plain` and `precise` show the same figures.
- **Zero external requests.** No fonts, no CDN, no analytics, no absolute URLs.
- **Static serving is doubly gated**: the resolved path must stay inside
  `web/`, and the extension must be in `STATIC_TYPES`. Everything else 404s.

## Invariants

- **No HTML-parsing sink.** `dom.ts` sets text through `textContent` and
  attributes through `setAttribute`. No `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`,
  `insertAdjacentHTML`, or `document.write` anywhere in `app/`. Ledger data is
  operator-supplied — project names come from folder names — and must never be
  able to become markup. Pinned by `test/dashboard-script.test.ts`.
- **Mutating routes require `x-segreant-local: 1`.** A cross-origin page cannot set
  a custom header without a preflight this server never answers, so a malicious
  site cannot drive the operator's local Segreant. Never relax this. The gate is
  DECLARED per route (`localOnly`) and enforced once, in `server.ts`, so it can
  be audited as a table instead of by reading every branch. A new mutating route
  adds itself to `MUTATING` in `test/dashboard-routes.test.ts`, which fails if
  the route ships without its gate.
- **A GET writes nothing.** GET is the one method no `localOnly` gate covers —
  a cross-origin page can issue one with no custom header, so no preflight to
  refuse — which makes "read-only" a security boundary here and not a style
  preference. A route that wants to persist what its preview saw does it on the
  guarded method. `GET /api/scan` broke this by recording its own walk as the
  new scan baseline; the baseline now moves only on `POST`.
- **Route matching is separate from route handling.** `routes.ts` declares what
  each path answers; `server.ts` enforces those declarations and calls the
  handler. No handler re-implements a 405, a 403, or a Host check, and no
  handler is a closure over the server — each is a named export that takes a
  `RouteContext`, so it can be called directly in a test with no socket.
- **Every route declares its methods; there is no "answers anything".** `Route.
  methods` is a required list, so a route cannot fall open by omission — an
  unlisted method is always a 405 with an `Allow`. Ten read routes carried a
  `null` here (inherited from the if-chain, which never method-checked them) and
  answered `DELETE`/`PATCH` with 200 and a full payload. They are `GET, HEAD`
  now. HEAD stays because Node drops the body itself, so it already worked;
  removing it would have traded a fall-open for a regression.
- **A CLI/GUI parity claim is a shared function, never a comment.** Where a
  route answers the same question as a CLI verb, both call one module:
  `/api/value` and the value commands compose `src/value/report.ts`;
  `/api/pricing` and `pricing --coverage` compose `src/cost/coverage.ts`;
  `/api/economic` and `economic --json` compose `src/cli/economicCmd.ts`. This
  repo has already paid for the alternative — five comments in the dashboard
  asserting its arithmetic matched the CLI's, which is asserting, not enforcing.
  A new route that restates a CLI computation inline is the defect.
- **A request the asset path cannot parse is a miss, never an exception.**
  `static.ts` reads the operator's disk, so it is reachable with input no other
  route sees. `decodeURIComponent` throws on a malformed escape (`%ZZ`, a
  trailing `%`, a truncated multi-byte sequence), and unguarded that URIError
  left the request handler as an **uncaught exception and ended the process** —
  one `<img src>` on any page the operator visited stopped their dashboard.
  Anything that fails to decode returns `false` and 404s. A new parsing step
  here inherits the same rule.
- **No route answers `OPTIONS`.** The CSRF gate above is worth exactly as much
  as this server's refusal to answer a preflight, so OPTIONS 405s like any other
  unserved method — a 405 carries no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, and no
  browser reads it as permission to send the real request. Adding an OPTIONS
  responder is the one change that could undo `localOnly` without touching it.
- **`Allow` headers are part of the response contract.** They are pinned to
  their historical values by test, including `/api/settings` advertising
  `GET, POST` while serving only GET. Correcting one is a behaviour change.
  `test/dashboard-routes.test.ts` keeps two pinned maps — inherited values in
  `HISTORICAL_ALLOW`, the newly-restricted reads in `READ_ONLY_ALLOW` — and
  asserts they together account for every route, so a new path cannot ship
  without a deliberate decision about which methods it answers.
- **The browser app never imports node code, and the server never imports the
  browser app.** Enforced structurally: `app/tsconfig.json` has the DOM lib and
  no node types, and the root configs exclude `app/**`.
- **Asynchronous evidence is announced.** Modern loading/error states expose
  status/alert semantics, and the classic view exposes current navigation/range
  state plus a text alternative for the spend chart. Source contracts improve
  the baseline, but they do not replace exact-candidate browser and screen-reader
  verification in the release gate.
- **A claim's meaning is derived, not fetched.** `claimLayers.ts` turns four
  payloads into four claims as a PURE function; `chain.ts` only reads the
  endpoints. The claims are where this product commits itself, so they must be
  reachable from a test with no socket and no ledger — the realized band spent a
  release rendering a cost, and the only thing that could catch it was a grep.
  A `null` payload means "that endpoint did not answer" and degrades exactly one
  layer, which is why a dead endpoint reads as missing evidence, never as zero.
- **Every claim answers all six evidence dimensions, and no claim is dated by
  another claim's evidence.** `ClaimInspection` requires provenance, scope,
  freshness, coverage, enforceability and evidence source; where one is not
  established the string says so, because a blank renders identically to a
  dimension nobody thought about. Freshness is a recorded instant or the words
  "not established" — never `new Date()`, which would report the age of the
  screen. `/api/allocation` carries the BILLING reconciliation as a deliberate
  cross-reference; reading it as allocation freshness dated a claim with zero
  runs by a provider reconciliation, and belongs in `assumptions` instead.
- **The browser's declared payload types are the wire's, and are corrected
  against it.** The app compiles against hand-written interfaces — it cannot
  import the node source that builds the payload — so a wrong declaration
  type-checks perfectly and fails silently at runtime. Two shipped that way:
  `reconciliation.runs` declared a number while the server sent an array (so
  `runs > 0` coerced through `NaN` and the Billed band could never light up),
  and a phantom `reconciliation.latest` the Evidence view read forever. A field
  that is on the wire and undeclared is the same defect facing the other way —
  it forces a cast. Presence-checking contract tests do not cover this; the
  shape and runtime primitive/array/record/interface/null-union types, against
  records that actually exist. It is still a conformance gate, not a generated
  single-source schema; the release gate keeps that distinction explicit.
  Since D-243 the deep walk is ONE function, `checkInterfaceShape` in
  `contracts.ts` (byte-copied into the browser): the client runs it on every
  JSON response after the envelope check, against the generated field table of
  `shared-types.ts`, and fails closed with a 502-class error naming the path;
  the contract test runs the same function against live routes. Server and
  browser therefore validate with the same walk and cannot drift apart. The
  server does not validate its own responses at send time.
- **Exact economic data has a read-only route and a typed client contract.**
  `GET/HEAD /api/economic` serves the CLI's canonical report with exact Money
  strings, source/effective request coverage, role-aware balances and bounded
  time-window validation. Its `periodClose` field carries the canonical
  half-open period's append-only finalization/reopen/conflict state and exact
  projection digest; the route remains read-only and never mutates close
  controls. It does not rewrite legacy value payloads or invent provider/billed
  authority; a dedicated dashboard view remains a downstream consumer
  migration rather than a second accounting implementation.
- **Route, envelope and named payload types are shared and fail closed.** The no-node
  dashboard contract drives API paths, methods, Allow headers, CSRF gates,
  response bindings and browser-surface bindings; the build copies it into the
  browser under the publication lock. Its top-level JSON/text payload contracts
  are validated by seeded conformance and by the modern client before a typed
  response is returned. The named payload interfaces now have one canonical
  no-runtime source in `shared-types.ts`; the build generates both the browser
  declaration copy and nested runtime metadata with the exact source hash under
  the same publication lock. The realization route now has a named nested gate,
  maturity, waste and exact-economic report contract; text/CSV and any future
  payloads that are not yet named remain explicit boundaries, as do full
  docs/claim/egress generation.
- **Capability parity is an immutable contract.** `CAPABILITY_SPECS` augments
  every GUI registry entry with input/preview/output schema classes, authority,
  egress, credentials, reversibility, assurance and CLI/API/GUI/docs bindings.
  Planned, read-only and destructive consequences are checked conservatively;
  the System view renders the specs rather than a second capability list.
- **Overlays mount once, on `body`, outside the shell's render root.** The shell
  effect re-runs on every register change and `render(root, …)` clears `#app`.
  Mounting inside it appended a fresh host and a never-disposed effect per
  toggle, so the panel was rebuilt N times into detached elements. Anything that
  reads `isPrecise()` inside a host effect is rebuilt in place, so its listeners
  and focus traps release through `onCleanup` — which runs before the next run —
  and never through a nested effect watching for close.
- **View effects are scoped to their rendered region.** View factories use
  `scopedEffect`, which registers their disposer with the active render binding;
  navigation therefore tears down fetch subscriptions. The Metered range fetch
  also aborts/sequence-checks stale responses and rejects a payload whose
  declared range differs from the selected range.
- **The Claim Inspector reads and never acts.** The drawer owns everything that
  changes state. A panel that argues the evidence and offers the button in the
  same box is the shape of every tool this one exists to disagree with.
- **`demo: true` must reach the screen.** Any payload that can be seeded is
  rendered with its demo banner. A screen that cannot say it is showing sample
  data is the one lie this product cannot afford.
- **Import specifiers must be relative and end in `.js`.** `tsc` type-checks the
  source tree while the browser resolves the emitted one, so a specifier that is
  fine for the compiler can still 404 in the browser. Pinned by test.
- **Adding a CLI verb means adding a registry row.** Otherwise the parity table
  silently overstates coverage, which is the exact failure mode this product
  exists to refuse.

## Verify

```bash
npm run build && npm test -- --test-name-pattern="dashboard|GUI"
node --test --experimental-strip-types test/dashboard-progressive-disclosure.test.ts test/dashboard-kernel-viewer.test.ts
```

The build must run first: three of these tests read the emitted `dist/` tree,
because that is what a browser actually loads.
