/**
 * Demo data generator.
 *
 * Produces a deterministic, clearly-synthetic dataset so every store-backed
 * surface — spend (summary / by-model / by-project / series / recent),
 * governance alerts, per-developer attribution, non-coding RoI, and the budget
 * advisor — is populated WITHOUT a real API key or days of live traffic.
 *
 * The product's honesty rule still holds. This data is:
 *   - isolated   — written to a separate `demo.db`, never the real store;
 *   - labeled    — every surface that shows it renders a "DEMO" marker;
 *   - priced for real — each synthetic request is costed by the production cost
 *                  engine (computeCost) against the same pricing table, so the
 *                  dollar figures are internally accurate for the tokens shown.
 *
 * The git-correlated value surfaces (Realization funnel, RoI Index, waste P&L,
 * per-context frontier) are lit the SAME way: synthetic work units carry
 * hand-authored gate verdicts — exactly what a real git analysis would derive —
 * then are scored and rolled up by the production functions (scoreFunnel →
 * rollupRealization → computeReturnOnIntelligence) and persisted via the real
 * writer. The demo therefore exercises the production value pipeline, not a
 * parallel fake; only the inputs are synthetic, and every surface stays DEMO.

 * depicts a hop that never happened. Attribution basis was the one axis that
 * self-negated — every row said `synthetic_demo`, so `segreant project --coverage`
 * and the dashboard's By-project card were structurally blank in the demo and
 * the two attribution mechanisms shipped in T-030/T-037 could not be seen at all
 * without a real repository and a real transcript corpus.
 *
 * So the demo now depicts the acquisition routes too. The guard is not the
 * per-row label — it is that the whole store is unambiguously demo (isolated in
 * `demo.db`, a DEMO marker on every surface, `demo: true` on every payload) and
 * that the coverage surface says in the same breath that these bases are
 * DEPICTED, not observed. A depicted basis must never be mistaken for a measured
 * one, and a number nobody can read is not the way to prevent that.
 *
 * The coupled fields travel together, so no seeded row can be internally
 * incoherent — an `unattributed` row cannot carry a project name, and an
 * imported row cannot claim it arrived through the proxy.
