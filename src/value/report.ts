/**
 * The value report — one composition of the value primitives, for every surface.
 *
 * The primitives in this directory are already deep and already shared:
 * `loadRealization`, `resolveBaselineMinutesForRepo`, `liftOptionsFromStore`,
 * `moneyInputsFromStore`, `computeReturnOnIntelligence`, `rateDriftStreams`,
 * `timeReclaimedFromStore`, `computeFrontier`, `computeUsageRoI`,
 * `computeCohort`, `recommendBudget`. What was NOT shared was the SEQUENCE that
 * assembles them into a report — the dashboard's `/api/value` and the CLI's
 * `roi` / `saved` / `usage` / `budget-advisor` commands each sequenced the same
 * primitives independently, and five comments in the dashboard source asserted
 * by hand that they matched ("Money inputs mirror the CLI exactly", "same
 * computation as the CLI so the two surfaces can't disagree", "priced exactly
 * like the CLI"). A hand-maintained invariant across two files is not an
 * invariant; it is a defect waiting for the next edit. This module IS that
 * invariant.
 *
 * THE ONE DISTINCTION THIS FILE MUST NOT COLLAPSE. Two different quantities sit
 * next to each other in the payload, and they are different claims:
 *
 *   realization.matured.spendOnRealizedUnitsUsd   attributed SPEND on units that
 *                                          realized — a COST that landed well.
 *   roi.returnRatio.manualEquivalentValueUsd      manual-equivalent VALUE
 *                                          produced — what the work would have
 *                                          cost done by hand, net of rework.
 *
 * They come from different evidence and answer different questions. Neither is
 * ever renamed into the other, and neither is ever computed from the other.
 * Until AII-012 they were BOTH spelled `realizedValueUsd`, which is how the
 * value spine came to render a cost while every typecheck passed.
 *
 * Ordering matters and is load-bearing:
 *   1. realization  — the spine; everything downstream is a lens on it.
 *   2. baseline     — resolved per repo (config override > this project's own
 *                     pre-AI git history shrunk toward a cited population prior
 *                     > the prior alone). Demo mode skips git entirely: the
 *                     seeded snapshots are not this checkout's real history.
 *   3. lift         — an observational time/comparative lens; its provenance
 *                     travels with it but it is not monetary causal credit.
 *   4. money        — priced from the SAME baseline the lens used, so the
 *                     dollar and the index can never disagree.
 *   5. RoI, drift, time reclaimed, frontier — all read (1)–(4), never the store
 *                     directly, so no surface can re-derive an input its own way.
