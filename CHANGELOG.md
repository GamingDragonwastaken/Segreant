# Changelog

Segreant is pre-1.0. This repository carries no tag and no GitHub release, so
everything below is unreleased. This file records user-visible changes from the
point at which release discipline was formalized; Git history remains the
authoritative record for earlier development. The verification procedure in
`docs/RELEASE-PROCESS.md` remains the release authority — an entry here is not
release evidence.

The format follows Keep a Changelog and releases will use Semantic Versioning.

## [Unreleased]

- **Free for people and companies: the license is now the Business Source
  License 1.1** with an Additional Use Grant (`LICENSE`, explained in
  `LICENSING.md`). Anyone may use, change and build on Segreant, including
  selling their own products built on it; offering Segreant as a hosted
  service and selling Segreant itself are not allowed. Each version becomes
  Apache 2.0 two years after it is published. No commercial license is sold;
  `COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md` is replaced by `LICENSING.md`.

- **The first run is about four times faster and says what it is doing.** A
  first `scan --setup` over 5.6 GB of agent logs went from 645 s, silent, to
  168 s with progress lines. Each file is blamed once per HEAD, git runs in a
  pool, imports commit in batches, log files already read in full are skipped
  (`import --rescan` reads them again), and opening the ledger no longer
  re-reads every economic event.

- **`today`, `week` and `month` head with list cost, not spend,** and say which
  part was read from tool logs ("not your invoice") and which was metered
  through the proxy.

- **The product is now Segreant.** It was called Fiscus until 2026-09-26; an
  unrelated AI-payments project owns that name on npm (D-290). The command is
  `segreant`, the environment overrides are `SEGREANT_HOME`, `SEGREANT_DB`,
  `SEGREANT_DEMO` and `SEGREANT_JUDGE_API_KEY`, the data directory is
  `~/.segreant`, and evidence packs are `.segreantpack` files with the schema
  `segreantpack`. The old names are not read, and a ledger created under the
  old name is not migrated: identifiers stored inside it changed with the
  name. It stays on disk untouched; Segreant starts a fresh ledger.

- **`segreant market`: compare models on public evidence before you have your
  own.** Coding uses the Aider polyglot leaderboard, whose published run costs
  give a real cost per solved task; chat, WebDev and image use LMArena ratings
  with their intervals and LiteLLM list prices. It works offline from a dated
  bundled snapshot, refreshes only through the egress gate
  (`market --refresh`, purpose `market_refresh`), states each source's licence
  and staleness, never forms a per-dollar ratio from ratings, and keeps your
  own realized value (`--repo`) beside the public figures, never inside them.
  Also in the Value view.
- **A consensus quality score in the market.** Many public benchmarks (Epoch
  AI's hub under CC BY 4.0, plus LMArena) combined per kind of work by a
  reliability-weighted, difficulty-adjusted fit, not a raw mean. Each score
  carries its range, the benchmarks behind it and the published weights; a
  model on one benchmark gets no score. Its ranking agrees with Epoch AI's
  Capabilities Index at Spearman 0.88 (coding) and 0.92 (chat).
- **`segreant outcome`: value for chat, image and other AI work.** Record a
  result's rating, decision, attempts, use and later durability; see cost per
  accepted and per used result by kind and model, always labelled
  self-reported and never added to git-verified coding value.
- **`segreant features`: switch optional subsystems off.** The market, each of
  its sources, and self-reported outcomes; preview, then `--apply`, or the
  Features drawer in System. A switched-off subsystem says so where its output
  would appear. Budget caps are not a switch.

### Security

- Budget/config persistence now fails closed: malformed or unenforceable caps
  are refused before provider dial, settings bodies are bounded and schema
  checked, and a ledger-write failure opens an explicit accounting circuit
  instead of silently allowing traffic.
- Egress receipt verification streams the retained hash chain in bounded chunks,
  refuses oversized individual lines, and keeps the checkpoint as an
  optimization rather than a second source of truth. Upstream `Location`
  headers are stripped on proxy redirects so downstream clients cannot follow
  outside Segreant's configured boundary.
- Optional team-server OIDC discovery refuses redirects, cross-origin JWKS,
  oversized responses, and unsafe endpoints; async aggregate failures return a
  bounded 503, and the default bind is loopback rather than all interfaces.
- The supported launcher now propagates spawn/signalled-child failures and
  refuses to bypass the publication lock on filesystem permission errors.
- Receipt checkpoints are no longer trusted as cross-process authority: a
  process validates the full chain before earning an in-memory append state;
  malformed-history diagnostics are bounded, and a 1 MiB line limit prevents a
  single corrupt record from becoming a memory sink.
- Restore now requires the integrity manifest emitted by `segreant backup`; a
  merely compatible arbitrary SQLite file can still be inspected, but cannot be
  promoted through the restore path.
- The synthetic benchmark always creates a temporary `SEGREANT_HOME`, so custom
  pricing caches and provenance in the caller's home cannot affect a run.
- Redacted diagnostics omit the complete custom pricing URL, retaining only a
  `sourceUrlConfigured` flag and safe pricing provenance fields.

- SQLite causal evidence tables now enable recursive triggers on every Store
  connection. `INSERT OR REPLACE` therefore cannot silently delete and replace
  an append-only evidence row; the regression suite exercises all protected
  causal tables through the raw connection as well as the typed write path.
- The local dashboard no longer exits on a malformed percent-escape in an asset
  path. `decodeURIComponent` threw a `URIError` out of the request handler with
  nothing to catch it, so any page the operator visited could stop Segreant with a
  single `<img src>`. A path that does not decode now 404s.
- `GET /api/scan` no longer writes. It recorded its own filesystem walk as the
  new scan baseline, which made it the one store write reachable without the
  `x-segreant-local: 1` header — and destroyed the drift it had just reported. The
  baseline now advances only on the guarded `POST`.
- Read-only dashboard routes answer only the methods they serve. Ten of them
  previously answered anything, so `DELETE /api/value` returned 200 and a full
  payload; they now return 405 with an `Allow` header. No route answers
  `OPTIONS`, which is what keeps the same-origin header gate meaningful.
- Dialog focus traps now treat the initially focused drawer/inspector container
  as a keyboard boundary, so the first `Shift+Tab` cannot escape to the opener.

### Fixed

- **Proxy and every other outbound request to a hostname failed on Node 20+.**
  The egress transport pinned sockets through a `lookup` that answered in the
  wrong form when Node asked for all addresses, so forwarding to
  `api.openai.com` / `api.anthropic.com`, pricing refresh, webhooks and team
  push all failed with `transport_failed` (HTTP 502 through the proxy). Only
  IP-literal targets worked. Fixed, with a real-socket regression test.
- The Return on Intelligence index is no longer described as an upper bound on
  the real conversion. An observed-only, renormalized index is not a ceiling:
  measuring a missing lens can move it either way. `instrumentationInterval`
  reports a partial-identification interval that evaluates unknown lenses at
  their admissible endpoints 0 and 1 under the full four-lens weight vector, and
  the observed-only score is reported alongside as the different quantity it is.
- The Impact lens is no longer reconstructed from the `merged` / `shipped` /
  `survived` verdicts that already determine Realization, which had made a lens
  sold as orthogonal move with the one it was meant to be independent of. Impact
  now requires an explicit orthogonal outcome signal or reports as
  uninstrumented.
- Amounts below one cent no longer render as `$0.00`. A $0.0020 soft threshold
  read as "no warning set" directly beneath a server alert quoting the real
  figure. Sub-cent amounts now carry two significant figures.
- The Control view reads the budget configuration by the field names the server
  actually sends, so a configured cap is no longer reported as absent and a
  cap-setting action is no longer accepted and silently discarded.
- The Realized band of the four-claim spine no longer renders attributed spend
  where it claims to report produced value. Both quantities are spelled
  `spendOnRealizedUnitsUsd` on the payload and only their definitions distinguish them.

### Changed

- Documentation: the README is now a short product page (what Segreant is, a
  30-second demo, real use, what it will not claim). The full command and
  design reference moved to `docs/GUIDE.md`, and `docs/README.md`
  indexes every document by audience. `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md` now includes
  the provider egress grant a proxy user needs, and no longer tells anyone to
  run `npx` with the old name, which would have fetched an unrelated package.
- `segreant backup --out` creates a verified SQLite `VACUUM INTO` snapshot with a
  hash/schema manifest, and `segreant restore` is preview-first and restores only
  into a new path. Corrupt, symlinked, or existing destinations fail closed;
  the active ledger is never overwritten.
- `segreant diagnostics --json` emits a versioned, redacted local handoff bundle
  with operation IDs, probe durations/error classes, schema/migration, egress,
  pricing, and resource observations. `--out` is an atomic non-overwriting
  export; no telemetry, prompts, source, credentials, or raw ledger rows leave
  the process.
- `npm run benchmark` provides synthetic small/current/10× and opt-in 100×
  performance observations for startup, ingest, query/value/API latency, RSS,
  and compiled artifact size without asserting a universal SLA.

- Concurrent builds now fingerprint their source generation before and after
  compilation and again inside the publication gate, retrying once on source
  drift. The supported CLI launcher acquires the same exclusive gate while it
  resolves the compiled module graph, so an older build cannot publish after a
  newer source generation merely because it finished compiling later.
- `npm test` performs the full reproducible build prerequisite. Package-boundary
  tests inspect Node runtime artifacts as well as browser output, so they no
  longer depend on `npm ci` having run `prepare` earlier in the checkout.
- V2 causal cost-bearing qualification now names the durable, append-only
  request-to-realization lineage sidecar. The Store-internal validator retains
  scalar metadata only, rejects raw prompts, source text, and unit snapshots,
  and remains fail-closed when ordinary ledger verification, a causally-bound
  realization identity, or any other evidence gate is unresolved. The sidecar
  is persisted internally; it is not yet a public evidence projection or
  release claim.
- The Store now has an internal independent causal-unit producer adapter. It
  authenticates the exact protocol, assignment, execution, matured outcome,
  request set, route scope, realization, and retained Git scalar rows; derives
  the unit identity without reading raw prompts or `unit_json`; verifies exact
  local ledger conservation and pricing lineage; and appends the scalar binding
  atomically. It remains local evidence, not a qualified causal result or
  provider invoice.
- Imported provider billing lines now expose exact append-only project/account
  mapping coverage in the Evidence dashboard and `/api/billing`, including
  mapped and residual amounts, status counts, targets, and the fact that these
  operator declarations remain excluded from budgets, RoI, and model advice.
- The CLI and the dashboard compose value through one shared sequence rather
  than assembling the same primitives independently in two places.

### Repository

- License changed from MIT to PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0, with commercial
  licenses available (`COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md`, since replaced by `LICENSING.md`).
  Commits up to `28dc6dd` remain MIT.
- Research modules recovered from the August `agent/truth-closure` lane into
  `src/research/` (Shapley decomposition, off-policy estimators, calibration,
  IRT complexity models and others), research-only and tested.
- CI runs the team server against a real PostgreSQL on every change.
- User-facing issue forms, Discussion category forms, and source archives that
  leave out maintainer and agent files.
- Commercial licenses state their refund policy, and are arranged through a
  discussion until a self-serve checkout exists. The GitHub Sponsors button was
  added and then withdrawn before any sponsorship was taken
  (`docs/NEUTRALITY.md`).
- `bin/segreant.mjs` and `standalone/segreantpack-verifier.mjs` are committed as
  executable, so `npm link` from a clone no longer leaves a mode change behind.
- Added security, contribution, pull-request, issue, and dependency-update
  policy surfaces for public maintenance.
