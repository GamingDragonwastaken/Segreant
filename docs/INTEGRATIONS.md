# Integrations — wiring Segreant to your tools

Segreant meters and caps AI spend by sitting **in the path** as a local proxy.
There is no per-tool plugin to install: any tool that (1) speaks the OpenAI or
Anthropic HTTP API and (2) lets you set a **base URL** is wired by configuration
alone. One running proxy meters *every* such tool at once — your IDE, your CLI
agent, and your scripts. The proxy forwards routed requests to the AI provider
you configure, so those requests can contain prompts, source snippets, tool
payloads, and provider credentials. Segreant has no Segreant-hosted telemetry by
default; read [DATA-BOUNDARIES.md](DATA-BOUNDARIES.md) for the complete egress
and local-retention contract.

```
your tool ──(base URL)──▶ Segreant :8090 ──price · cap · log──▶ provider
```

The mental model: **point the tool's base URL at Segreant, and point Segreant's
upstream at the provider.** That's the whole integration.

---

## The three knobs

| Knob | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Your tool's base URL | the tool's config / env | sends the tool's traffic to Segreant instead of straight to the provider |
| `upstreams.openai` / `upstreams.anthropic` | `~/.segreant/config.json` | where Segreant forwards, after metering |
| `egress` rule | `segreant egress apply --apply ...` | the exact cloud method/origin/path/data class Segreant may forward |

For native OpenAI or Anthropic, the upstream defaults are correct and need no
other step: forwarding to their official APIs is built in, because that traffic
was already going there. You touch the upstream setting only to meter an
OpenAI-*compatible* provider that isn't OpenAI (Gemini, OpenRouter, DeepSeek,
Ollama, …). A remote one of those needs one exact `provider_inference` rule; a
refused request prints the command. A local server on `localhost` needs none.

For example, before routing traffic to a gateway:

```bash
segreant egress apply --apply --mode controlled_cloud \
  --id provider-openrouter-ai-ca864c2b-post --purpose provider_inference \
  --data-class provider_request --method POST \
  --origin https://openrouter.ai --path-prefix /
```

The receipt chain is local and redacted: `segreant egress verify` checks its
integrity. A genuinely absent file may establish genesis, but any present
invalid/unreadable history or lock/persistence failure refuses the routed
request before DNS or dial and is not reset automatically; repair or restore it
before retrying. If the bounded lock wait reports a stale lock, confirm that no
Segreant writer is active, remove only that lock, and rerun receipt verification;
the transport never auto-deletes it. Neither a rule nor a valid receipt guarantees another
process's network behaviour or the provider's retention policy.

### The base-URL `/v1` rule (read this once)

Segreant forwards the **incoming path** onto the upstream base. So the upstream
base must contain the provider's version segment, and the tool's base URL must
*not* duplicate it:

- **OpenAI** (default upstream `https://api.openai.com`): tool base URL =
  `http://localhost:8090/v1` → forwarded to `…/v1/chat/completions`. ✅
- **Gemini** (upstream `…/v1beta/openai`): tool base URL = `http://localhost:8090`
  (**no `/v1`**) → forwarded to `…/v1beta/openai/chat/completions`. ✅ A `/v1`
  here would double the version and 404.

Rule of thumb: **whatever version segment lives in `upstreams.openai`, leave it
off the tool's base URL.**

## Metering Gemini on the free tier (the $0 test)

This is the recommended way to watch real agent traffic accrue without spending a
cent — Gemini 2.5 Flash is free-tier, and it doubles as proof of Segreant's
multi-provider pricing.

**1. Point Segreant's OpenAI upstream at Google.** `~/.segreant/config.json`:

```json
{
  "upstreams": {
    "openai": "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai"
  }
}
```

**2. Start the proxy:** `segreant start` (proxy on :8090, dashboard on :8091).

**3. Set your key in the environment** — this is the one secret Segreant never
stores and never needs to see. Get a free key from Google AI Studio, then:

```powershell
# PowerShell (persists for new shells)
setx GEMINI_API_KEY "your-key-here"
```

Open a **new** terminal after `setx` so the variable is visible.

**4. Run a tool through it** (opencode recipe below) with model
`gemini-2.5-flash`. Traffic is metered into your real ledger; watch it at
**http://localhost:8091** or with `segreant today`.

**To revert to real OpenAI later:** set `upstreams.openai` back to
`https://api.openai.com` (or delete `config.json` to restore all defaults).

> **Pricing:** Gemini rates are built in and verified. Rates drift — keep them
> current with `segreant pricing --refresh` (see [pricing](#keeping-pricing-current)).

## Per-tool recipes

### opencode

opencode reads `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc`. Add a provider (this is the
exact shape Segreant ships set up):

```jsonc
{
  "provider": {
    "segreant": {
      "name": "Segreant → Gemini (metered)",
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "http://localhost:8090",
        "apiKey": "{env:GEMINI_API_KEY}"
      },
      "models": {
        "gemini-2.5-flash": { "name": "Gemini 2.5 Flash (via Segreant)" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `{env:GEMINI_API_KEY}` substitution keeps your key in the environment, never
in the file. In opencode, run `/models` and pick the Segreant provider's model.

### aider

```bash
# bash / zsh
export OPENAI_API_BASE="http://localhost:8090/v1"   # native OpenAI: keep /v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY="$OPENAI_KEY"
aider --model gpt-4o
```

For Gemini-via-Segreant, set `OPENAI_API_BASE="http://localhost:8090"` (no
`/v1`), `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your Gemini key, and `--model gemini-2.5-flash`.

### Cursor

Settings → Models → **Override OpenAI Base URL** → `http://localhost:8090/v1`.
Cursor's verification call must succeed, so the proxy must be running. Your key
goes in Cursor as usual; Segreant forwards it untouched.

### Continue / Cline (VS Code)

In the model config, set `apiBase` (Continue) or the OpenAI-compatible base
(Cline) to `http://localhost:8090/v1`.

### Antigravity

Antigravity supports custom OpenAI-compatible models — set the model's base URL
to `http://localhost:8090/v1` (or `http://localhost:8090` when routing through a
non-OpenAI upstream like Gemini, per the `/v1` rule above).

### Claude Code / Anthropic SDK

```powershell
$env:ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8090"
```

No upstream change needed — `upstreams.anthropic` already points at
`api.anthropic.com`.

### Any OpenAI / Anthropic SDK (your own scripts)

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8090/v1", api_key="…")
```

## Beyond one provider, from one proxy

To meter several OpenAI-compatible providers without restarting, enable
Do not route providers per request with `x-segreant-openai-base`: current Segreant
builds ignore that legacy header because the proxy forwards provider credentials.
Set one trusted OpenAI-compatible destination in `upstreams.openai` instead.

```
X-Segreant-OpenAI-Base: https://openrouter.ai/api
```

It's **off by default on purpose** — that header forwards your provider key to the
URL it names, so Segreant only honors it when you opt in. For a single provider,
just set `upstreams.openai` and skip the flag.

**Pricing follows the model, not the wire.** A `gemini-*` model arriving over the
OpenAI path is priced at Google's real rate, a `claude-*` via OpenRouter at
Anthropic's — the rate card resolves by model family across providers, so a
provider you route through one transport is still priced correctly.

---

## Keeping pricing current

Pricing is a core dependability, and provider rates change. The table ships
bundled (works offline) and can be refreshed in place:

```bash
segreant pricing             # source, age, model count, staleness
segreant pricing --refresh   # pull the latest rates (a plain GET; sends nothing about you)
```

A refreshed table is written to `~/.segreant/pricing/models.json` and overrides
the bundled one. A malformed download is rejected and your current table is kept
— a bad refresh never downgrades your data.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `404` from the provider | double `/v1` (tool base URL **and** upstream both carry a version) | drop `/v1` from the tool base URL when the upstream already has a version segment |
| `401 / 403` | key not in the environment, or wrong key for the upstream | confirm the env var is set in the shell that launched the tool; open a new shell after `setx` |
| Tool's "verify" fails | proxy not running | `segreant start`, then retry |
| Cost shows `estimated` | model id not in the rate card | `segreant pricing --refresh`, or check the model name |
| Nothing in the dashboard | tool didn't route through the proxy | re-check the base URL; `segreant today` to confirm requests land |
