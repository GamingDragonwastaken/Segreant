# Neutrality

Segreant's core product runs with no hosted service, no account, and no
payment, for people and organizations alike. Money, when it is taken, is kept outside the
product (see "Sponsorship" below). This states what that means concretely and
which paths are opt-in add-ons rather than requirements.

## The core requires nothing hosted

`npm install && npm run demo` or `npm run start` runs entirely against a local
SQLite ledger and a local proxy/dashboard — no signup, no license key, no
Segreant-operated account, no telemetry by default
(`docs/DATA-BOUNDARIES.md`). No donation, sponsorship prompt, or paid tier
gates any function described in `PRODUCT.md`. This document exists
so that claim stays checkable rather than aspirational: every egress path
listed below is the complete set (`docs/DATA-BOUNDARIES.md`'s declared-egress
table is enforced by a test that pins it against the code in both
directions), so a hosted requirement could not be added without appearing
there.

## Every non-local path is opt-in, named, and scoped

Each of these requires an explicit operator action or configuration; none
runs by default:

| Path | Requires |
| --- | --- |
| Proxy traffic to an AI provider | Pointing a tool at the Segreant proxy — this is the product's function, not a Segreant-operated service |
| Pricing manifest refresh | `segreant pricing --refresh` or `pricing.autoRefresh` |
| Baseline manifest refresh | `segreant baseline --refresh --url ...`, operator-supplied URL |
| Alert webhook delivery | `segreant alerts --set-webhook ...` |
| Provider cost observation | `segreant billing openai-costs pull ... --apply`, one fixed OpenAI endpoint |
| Team rollup | `segreant team push --url ...`, to an operator-run team server |
| Hosted judge | An explicitly configured hosted judge provider |

None of these is a Segreant-operated account, subscription, or telemetry
collector — they are, respectively, a public manifest fetch, an
operator-configured webhook, a provider's own billing endpoint, and an
operator-run server. Segreant has no billing relationship with any user and
collects nothing centrally.

## Product and project neutrality

- The LICENSE is the Business Source License 1.1 with an Additional Use
  Grant (2026-10-08, replacing PolyForm Noncommercial, D-287): any person or
  organization may use, change and build on Segreant with no account, key or
  payment; offering it as a hosted service and selling Segreant itself are
  not allowed; each version becomes Apache 2.0 two years after publication
  (`LICENSING.md`). No function behaves differently for anyone: the license
  is a legal term, not a feature gate. Earlier commits carried MIT, copyright "Segreant contributors".
- `docs/RELEASE-GATE.md`'s "Product claims allowed at this stage" section
  fixes the precise language this project may use about itself and forbids
  overclaiming (not "AI financial advice," not "zero egress," not a verified
  production deployment) — the same discipline applied to marketing claims
  that `CLAUDE.md` applies to accounting claims.
- There is no paid placement and no vendor whose product is
  favored in comparison surfaces (`docs/RETURN-ON-INTELLIGENCE.md`'s model
  trials are explicitly review-only and do not automatically reallocate
  budget or rank providers as causal evidence).

## Sponsorship

Segreant does not take sponsorship today; there is no Sponsor button, and no
license is sold. If sponsorship, a paid arrangement under different terms,
or any other payment channel is opened, these rules apply to it:

- **Nothing is gated.** Every function works the same for someone who never
  sponsors. There is no license key, no "supporter edition", and no feature
  that sponsorship unlocks.
- **No sponsorship from vendors Segreant compares.** Segreant prices and compares
  AI providers, gateways and model hosts. Money from any of them would make the
  comparison surfaces look bought, so none is accepted. Individuals and
  companies that only use AI tools are fine.
- **No sponsorship affects a figure, a comparison, or a recommendation.**
- **The product does not ask.** There is no sponsorship prompt in the CLI or
  the dashboard today. If one is ever added it must be local-only (no network
  call to decide whether to show it), shown rarely, dismissible permanently,
  never printed in `--json` output, non-interactive sessions, or CI, and
  documented in the public change review before it ships.

## Public-interest governance note

Because there is one maintainer today (`GOVERNANCE.md`), "neutral" here means
"no hosted lock-in and no financial relationship gating functionality," not
"governed by a foundation or multiple independent maintainers." If that
changes, it will be recorded as a decision-log entry, not a quiet edit to this
page.

## What this document does not promise

It does not control what a configured AI provider does with data it receives,
and it is not a guarantee that a future version will keep every path above
free — a change to that would need to survive the review this page exists to
invite, and would be recorded here and in the public change review when
it happens.
