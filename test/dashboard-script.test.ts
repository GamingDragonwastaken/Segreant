/**
 * The GUI's highest-blast-radius failure is a page that does not run at all.
 *
 * When the dashboard was one file with one inline script, a single bad character
 * anywhere in it killed the whole page silently — nothing rendered, no view
 * switched, and the API kept returning perfect JSON the entire time, so every
 * HTTP-level check still passed. That was not hypothetical: an over-escaped
 * apostrophe inside a tooltip string took the console down while the API tests,
 * the typecheck, and the build all stayed green.
 *
 * Splitting into modules changed the shape of that failure but not its severity.
 * A module that fails to parse, or an import specifier the browser cannot
 * resolve, takes the whole app down just as completely — and `tsc` will not
 * catch a bad specifier, because it type-checks the source tree while the
 * browser resolves the EMITTED one.
 *
 * So this walks what actually ships: both HTML entry points, every emitted
 * module, and every import specifier between them.
