 * this repository has zero runtime dependencies (only `typescript` and
 * `@types/node` as devDependencies), Node ships no DOM implementation, and
 * pulling in jsdom/puppeteer/happy-dom to get one would itself violate that
 * rule. So these assertions prove the markup and CSS this app emits carry the
 * right roles, attributes and heading levels — not that a browser's
 * accessibility tree actually renders them that way. No runtime
