/**
 * Losing the lock directory before publishing ownership is a lost race.
 *
 * `acquirePublicationLock` creates `.segreant-build.lock` with `mkdir`, then
 * writes an owner record into it. Between those two steps the directory exists
 * and carries no owner, which makes it indistinguishable from one an
 * interrupted process abandoned. If it is removed in that window, the
 * legitimate creator's `writeFileSync` throws ENOENT.
 *
 * That threw straight out of the CLI. CI run `33502986214` failed
 * `test (windows-latest)` with
 *
 *     Error: ENOENT: ... open '...\.segreant-build.lock\.owner-<uuid>.tmp'
 *       at acquirePublicationLock (bin/publication-lock.mjs:307)
 *       at bin/segreant.mjs:53
 *
 * so `segreant --help` died while two builds were publishing. The launcher is
 * right to treat a lock FAILURE as fatal — bypassing the gate would make a
 * reader's artifact guarantee rest on an unverified filesystem assumption — but
 * this is not a failure. This process did not acquire the lock. It belongs in
 * the wait loop.
 *
 * The second half of the repair matters more than the first. The old catch
 * block, seeing `created === true`, quarantined `buildLock` BY PATHNAME to tidy
 * up after itself. By then the directory is gone, so any directory at that path
 * belongs to someone else — the cleanup took a fresh lock away from another
 * process inside ITS owner-write window and propagated the same ENOENT to it.
 *
 * ENUMERATING ERRNOS WAS THE WRONG SHAPE OF FIX. The first repair listed the
 * three codes Windows produces. Run `33505785655` then failed on macOS with a
 * fourth, EINVAL from writing into an unlinked directory — because the list is a
 * property of the kernel it happens to run on. What does not vary is where the
 * failure happened: the owner record is what makes the lock ours, so a creator
 * that failed to publish one holds nothing, whatever the failure was called.
 *
 * WHAT THESE TESTS ESTABLISH, AND WHAT THEY DO NOT. They manufacture the
 * condition directly: a second process deletes the canonical lock in a tight
 * loop while a contender acquires and releases. That is the state the CI log
 * shows, and it fails on the unrepaired code. It is NOT a reproduction of the
 * interleaving that produced that state in CI, which was never observed — only
 * its signature. So this covers the RESPONSE to a vanished lock directory, and
 * says nothing about what made one vanish under two concurrent builders.

  //
  // MANUFACTURING THE PRECONDITION. Both call sites are reachable only through a
  // genuine interleaving — an owner record appearing between the inspection that
  // said "unknown" and the re-read after the rename — so this cannot be driven
  // by planting a single state. What it CAN do is make the window common: a
  // thief re-creates the canonical path as a NON-EMPTY directory (a valid owner
  // record naming a process that has already exited) every time it observes the
  // path go absent, which is exactly the moment a quarantine is outstanding. The
  // dead owner keeps it immediately reclaimable, so workers still make progress
  // instead of serving the ten-second ownerless age.
  //
  // BOUNDED WORK RATHER THAN A WALL CLOCK, after this test hung its own CI job.
  // It first drove both sides with `while (Date.now() < until)` loops, which
  // made the thief a busy spin on a failing `mkdir`; four of those on a two-core
  // runner starve one another, and a worker that enters one more acquisition
  // just before its deadline then waits inside it against a five-minute
  // `LOCK_WAIT_MS`. Run `33776671068` killed a worker at the harness's
  // three-minute window with nothing to read: the job failed for want of a
  // scheduler, not for a defect. Both sides are now counted — five laps each,
  // four hundred thief attempts with a two-millisecond yield between them — so
  // the whole scenario is finite, and the assertions say so: every worker must
  // complete all five laps, and the thief must have claimed the path at least
  // once, which is what proves the canonical path went absent underneath a
  // contender at all.
  //
  // WHAT THIS DOES NOT ESTABLISH. It cannot go RED on Windows, where the
  // occupied-target rename answers EPERM or EEXIST — both of which the old list
  // already tolerated. The defect and its repair are visible only where the

/**
 * THE GRACE PERIOD BELONGS TO THE CANONICAL PATH, NOT TO A QUARANTINE.
 *
 * `reapOrphanQuarantines` asks `lockIsStale`, which answers a DIFFERENT
 * question: may I take this canonical lock? Half of that answer transfers — an
 * owner who cannot still act is gone, wherever the directory sits — and half
 * does not. For an owner-LESS directory `lockIsStale` waits
 * `OWNERLESS_LOCK_STALE_MS`, and the reason is stated in its own comment: the
 * creator died "between `mkdir` and its first write", so the ten seconds
 * protect a live process that is about to write its record into a directory it
 * has just made.
 *
 * No such process can exist at a quarantine pathname. A quarantine is only ever
 * created by RENAMING an existing directory aside; nothing is ever `mkdir`ed
 * there, and no creator will ever come back to a name it does not know. So the
 * ten seconds protect nobody and delay collection of a directory that is
 * already garbage.
 *
 * HOW THE WINDOW IS REACHED IN PRACTICE, which is what run `33760552077` found
 * on Ubuntu and Windows both. `quarantineKnownLock` renames whatever is at the
 * canonical path at the instant it acts, which need not be the generation it
 * inspected: a contender can quarantine and remove that generation and a third
 * process can `mkdir` a fresh empty one in between. The mismatch is then
 * detected — that is what the re-read of the owner record is for — restoration
 * is attempted, and when the canonical path has been claimed again it fails,
 * which is the ordinary lost race D-092 recorded. What is left behind is an
 * EMPTY quarantine: a directory whose creator can no longer find it and whose
 * record was never written. The reaper then preserved it for ten seconds, and
 * an immediate sweeping acquisition reported residue.
 *
 * These three tests state the transition rule directly rather than reproducing
 * the interleaving, which is the whole of the directive's preference for a
 * state-machine test: a planted state is deterministic on every platform, where
 * the race that produces it is not.
