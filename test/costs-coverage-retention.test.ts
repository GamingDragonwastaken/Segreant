/**
 * The report that decides whether to go and get a provider credential said the
 * local side was empty, over a period whose local rows it had deleted.
 *
 * THE COUNTEREXAMPLE, MEASURED. A fully paginated OpenAI Costs observation over
 * a past month, and ten live proxy requests on the declared route inside it
 * totalling $180.00. `segreant billing costs coverage` reported `Declared route
 * 10 live proxy request(s), $180.00`. `segreant prune` then deleted rows older
 * than the middle of that period, and the same report read:
 *
 *     Declared route 0 live proxy request(s), $0.00 local estimate, not the bill
 *
 * **with the blocker list byte-for-byte identical.** Not one of the five named
 * a deletion, because all five are permanent conditions and this one is not.
 *
 * WHY THIS SURFACE AND NOT ANOTHER. Capture coverage exists to answer one
 * question before an operator spends anything: is the local side ready, or
 * would a reconciliation come back empty? `printReadiness` on the same command
 * prints "READ THIS BEFORE GETTING A CREDENTIAL. You have OpenAI spend, and
 * none of it would count toward a reconciliation." **So this is the emptiness-
 * followed-by-advice class attached to the most expensive errand in the
 * product** — minting an Admin credential against a real billing account — and
 * the advice is derived from a number retention emptied.
 *
 * WHY NOT A SIXTH BLOCKER. `blockers` is a fixed-length tuple of five
 * conditions that hold ALWAYS: an unverified scope, unobservable off-path
 * usage, undocumented finality, line items that do not join, and rate-card
 * estimates. Retention truncation holds SOMETIMES. Putting a conditional fact
 * in a list whose meaning is "these are permanent" would either make it read as
 * permanent or make the tuple's promise false, so the coverage carries it as
 * its own field — the same separation D-173 made between the permanent
 * reconciliation conditions and `local_ledger_truncated_by_retention`.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT ESTABLISH. That the reconciliation itself is affected:
 * D-173 already closed that path, and this is the READINESS report that runs
 * before it. That the provider side is complete — `providerFinality` is
 * `undocumented` and stays so. That the other two absence sentences on this
 * command are affected: `'No direct provider observation runs recorded.'` and
 * `'No OpenAI billing export has been imported.'` read observation and import
 * tables, and no `DELETE` in the store touches either — traced per sentence,
 * which is what frontier item 12(b) asked for, and they are sound.
 *
 * Recorded at D-185.
