/**
 * The parity map's own rule was not enforced, so its denominator was wrong
 * (WP-I03).
 *
 * WHAT THE REGISTRY SAYS ABOUT ITSELF. `src/dashboard/web/app/core/registry.ts`
 * opens with the argument: "The GUI is meant to reach full parity with the CLI.
 * A claim like that is worth nothing unless it is checkable, and this product's
 * whole argument is that important claims should be inspectable -- so parity is
 * a data structure, not a promise in a README." It closes that docblock with
 * "Adding a CLI verb without adding its row is the one change this file exists
 * to make awkward."
 *
 * IT WAS NOT AWKWARD. Nothing compared the registry with the CLI's dispatch.
 * Six capability groups reached a `case` in `src/cli.ts` with no row here:
 * `start`, `init`, `economic`/`economics`, `backup`, `restore`, and
 * `diagnostics`/`diagnostic`. The System view renders "N of 47 capabilities" at
 * full parity from `paritySummary()`, and 47 was the size of the list rather
 * than the size of the CLI -- a coverage figure computed over a population that
 * silently excluded every capability nobody had gotten around to listing.
 *
 * WHICH DIRECTION THE ERROR RAN, BOTH WAYS. Omitting `backup`, `restore`,
 * `diagnostics` and `init` -- which have no GUI surface -- made the parity
 * fraction look BETTER than it is, because a capability with no GUI cannot drag
 * the ratio down if it is not in the denominator. Omitting `economic`, which
 * the modern app does surface (`/api/economic` is a declared route with a
 * `modern-api` browser binding), made it look worse. A denominator that is
 * wrong in both directions at once is not a rounding problem; it is a figure
 * with no basis, which is the one thing this repository refuses.
 *
 * `not_applicable` IS A FOURTH STATE, NOT A FOURTH WAY OF SAYING `planned`.
 * `segreant start` is the command that serves the GUI. By the time there is a
 * page to click, it has already run. Calling that `planned` would assert that
 * a GUI surface for it is coming, which is not true and not intended; calling
 * it `full` or `partial` would be worse. The honest answer is that the GUI
 * cannot offer it, stated with the reason -- and `coverageNote` is required
 * exactly there, so the state cannot become a place to file anything awkward.
 *
 * WHY THE DRAWER WAS NOT TAUGHT THIS STATE. `core/actions.ts` has a fallback
 * blocked reason that says "This runs from the command line", which is false
 * for `not_applicable`. Teaching it the new state would have been a branch no
 * caller reaches: `actionCard()` is invoked with explicit ids in the six views
 * and none of the six commands added here is among them, so the drawer never
 * receives one. That is the repository's second recurring defect class -- a
 * mechanism built and never wired -- and the alternative to building it is not
 * silence. The last test below refuses an action card for a `not_applicable`
 * capability, so the day a view surfaces one, the wrong message is a failing
 * test rather than a sentence an operator reads and believes.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT ESTABLISH. That any row's `coverage` value is CORRECT --
 * only that every CLI capability has a row and that a row claiming
 * `not_applicable` explains itself. Whether `economic` is really `partial`
 * rather than `full` is a judgement about the GUI's economic surface that no
 * test here checks, and the same is true of every other row: the parity map
 * remains a set of honest human claims, now over the right population.
 *
 * Recorded at D-167.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * THE CHECK ABOVE READ ONE WORD (WP-I03, second pass). Both directions of the
 * population test compared `command.split(' ')[0]` with the dispatch: the verb,
 * and nothing after it. `segreant billing openai-costs adopt --apply` was
 * checked as `billing`; `segreant config --clear-proposals` was checked as
 * `config`. A row could document any subcommand path and any flag, and as long
 * as the first word reached a `case`, it counted as a command the CLI runs.
 *
 * IT WAS VACUOUS FOR EXACTLY ONE ROW, AND THAT ROW IS DESTRUCTIVE. `segreant
 * config --clear-proposals` does not exist. `cmdConfig` reads no such flag and
 * never has -- a pickaxe search over the CLI's history finds the string in no
 * CLI source at any commit -- so the command prints the config and exits 0
 * while the row beside it, in the drawer, with a copy button, calls it the
 * shortcut for deleting every captured proposal. The operation is real: the
 * GUI posts to `/api/settings/clear-proposals`, which calls
 * `store.clearProposals()`. The CLI simply has no way to do it, and the row
 * said otherwise.
 *
 * WHAT THE CHECK NOW READS. Every documented command is parsed into its verb,
 * its subcommand words and its flags (`--` ends parsing, `<placeholder>` is
 * skipped). The verb must reach a dispatch case, as before. Each subcommand
 * word must appear as a string literal in the code that handles that verb --
 * the `case` group's own body plus the module `src/cli.ts` imports the handler
 * from, resolved from the import list rather than guessed. Each flag must be
 * READ there: `flags.<name>`, `flags['<name>']`, or `'<name>'` handed to a
 * flag-reading helper. That is a reading of the handler, not a second opinion
 * about what it accepts; D-166 declined to pin flags to commands because the
 * CLI declares no per-action schema, and that is still true -- this pins them
 * to the module that would have to read them, which is the strongest bound the
 * source supports without executing every command.
 *
 * THE BOUND IS THE MODULE, AND THAT IS STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN. `showCmd.ts`
 * hosts six handlers, so a flag one of them reads would satisfy a row that
 * documents it on another. That is weaker than a per-function check and much
 * stronger than a per-verb check; it catches a flag no code in the right file
 * reads, which is what the one real defect was.
 *
 * THE ROW IS CORRECTED, NOT THE CHECK. A capability the GUI offers and the CLI
 * does not is a state the parity map had no way to say, because the map's
 * premise runs the other way. It now says it: a `command` that does not start
 * with `segreant ` is not a CLI claim, must name a declared API route, and
 * carries an empty CLI binding. Adding the flag to `cmdConfig` instead would
 * have made the row true by building a destructive CLI path nobody had decided
 * to build, which is not this packet's call.
