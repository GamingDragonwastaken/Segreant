/**
 * Window totals were printed over a range the ledger no longer covers.
 *
 * D-170 recorded the retention boundary and taught `segreant guide` to read it,
 * because that is the one surface that turns a count into a claim about whether
 * something ever happened. It left the window surfaces untouched and said so.
 * This is that remainder for the three that can reach behind the boundary.
 *
 * WHICH SURFACES, AND WHY THESE THREE. `segreant sources --all` sets its window
 * start to 0 and prints the words "all time". `segreant export --all` does the
 * same and emits every surviving row as CSV or JSON. `segreant export --days N`
 * accepts up to 3650 days. `segreant today/week/month` are bounded to a month, so
 * the default 180-day retention cannot reach them — but retention is operator
 * configurable and nothing stops a seven-day policy, so the disclosure is on
 * the shared window path rather than on the commands that happen to be long
 * today.
 *
 * TRUNCATION IS A COMPARISON, NOT A FLAG ON THE LEDGER. A window is truncated
 * when a boundary is on record AND the window starts strictly before it. A
 * window starting exactly at the boundary is intact: `prune` deletes rows
 * strictly older than the boundary, so the boundary instant itself survived.
 * Getting that edge wrong in the safe direction would put a warning on every
 * report forever, which is how a disclosure becomes noise and stops being read.
 *
 * NOT TRUNCATED IS NOT THE SAME AS COMPLETE. With no boundary on record,
 * `truncated` is false and `prunedBeforeMs` is null, and the second field is
 * the one that carries the meaning: no prune is ON RECORD. A ledger pruned
 * before `retention_prunes` existed reports exactly this, and inferring a
 * boundary from the oldest surviving row would be the provenance invention this
 * project's second hard rule forbids. So callers get both fields and the CLI
 * says nothing extra in that state rather than asserting coverage it has not
 * got.
 *
 * THE EXPORT NOTICE GOES TO STDERR, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING. `segreant export`
 * writes CSV or JSON to stdout for a pipe or a redirect. A disclosure line on
 * stdout would corrupt every consumer of it — the fix would break the thing it
 * was protecting. It goes where `--out`'s own confirmation already goes, and
 * the test below parses stdout to prove the data stream stayed clean.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT ESTABLISH. That the dashboard discloses truncation:
 * `/api/overview` and the browser views still read window summaries with no
 * coverage field, which is a payload-contract change and is not made here. Nor
 * that a window INSIDE the retained period is complete for any other reason —
 * this is about deletion only, and says nothing about traffic that never
 * reached Segreant, which is the separate and permanent limit of a local meter.
 *
 * Recorded at D-171.
