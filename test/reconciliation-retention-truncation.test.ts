/**
 * A reconciliation must know when its own ledger was truncated by retention.
 *
 * THE COUNTEREXAMPLE, MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS WRITTEN DOWN. A provider reported
 * $10.00 over two days. Segreant had metered $6.00 on each of them, so the
 * residual was -$2.00 and the run said `none_local_estimate_exceeds_provider`:
 * the local rate-card estimate exceeds everything the provider billed on this
 * scope, so no upper bound on off-path spend survives. That is the alarming,
 * honest state, and D-068 exists to make it visible.
 *
 * Then `segreant prune` deleted the first day's request on the operator's own
 * retention policy. The same reconciliation, over the same period, against the
 * same provider report, now said: residual +$4.00, `upper_bound_conditional`.
 * A deletion RESTORED a bound the evidence refutes, and re-labelled $6.00 of
 * Segreant's own metered traffic as spend the provider charged for and Segreant
 * never saw. Nothing anywhere in the run mentioned retention.
 *
 * WHY THE ARITHMETIC DOES THIS. With P the provider total, L what Segreant
 * metered on the scope, T the true billed cost of on-path traffic and O of
 * off-path traffic: `P = T + O`, `R = P - L = O + (T - L)`, so `O <= R` holds
 * exactly when `L <= T`. Retention does not change P, T or O. It changes what
 * can be COMPUTED for L: the surviving ledger yields `L' = L - D` for some
 * deleted on-path amount `D >= 0` that no surviving row records. So the
 * computed residual is `R' = R + D`.
 *
 * THE RULE THAT FOLLOWS IS ASYMMETRIC, AND THE ASYMMETRY IS THE WHOLE FIX.
 *
 *   A REFUTATION SURVIVES TRUNCATION. `R' < 0` implies `R = R' - D <= R' < 0`,
 *   so a negative residual still establishes `L > T`. Truncation can only HIDE
 *   a refutation, never manufacture one, and refusing to report one because the
 *   ledger was pruned would discard a sound conclusion.
 *
 *   AN UPPER BOUND DOES NOT. `R' >= 0` implies nothing about the sign of R,
 *   because D is unknown. `upper_bound_conditional` is therefore not
 *   established, and reporting it is the absence inference AII-002 names: an
 *   absence produced by deletion read as an absence of events.
 *
 * So the third state is `unknown_local_total_truncated_by_retention`, and it is
 * a refusal to classify rather than a weaker classification.
 *
 * THE THREE STATES OF THE RETENTION RECORD ARE PRESERVED (D-170). A boundary on
 * record with a period starting at or after it is intact and says nothing
 * extra. NO boundary on record is UNKNOWN, not "nothing was pruned" -- a ledger
 * pruned before `retention_prunes` existed reports exactly that, and inferring
 * a boundary from the oldest surviving row would invent the provenance this
 * project refuses to infer. Neither of those licenses a sentence about deleted
 * data, and two tests below hold that a clean ledger stays quiet.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT TESTED HERE, AND WHY IT IS GATED ANYWAY. That the wire and the
 * browser carry the third state is enforced by the compilers rather than by
 * this file: `src/dashboard/routes.ts` assigns the run's bound into the
 * payload, so a `shared-types.ts` union missing the member fails the ROOT
 * typecheck, and the browser renders through a `Record` keyed by that union, so
 * a missing rendering fails the BROWSER typecheck. A test asserting the same
 * thing would be weaker than the two compilers that already refuse it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT ESTABLISH. That the residual is otherwise trustworthy --
 * the five conditions on every run say otherwise and none of them is closed
 * here. Nor that D is small: it is unknown by construction, and the point of
 * the new state is that it is unknown rather than that it is large. Nor
 * anything about `pruneProposals`, which deletes proposal rows and cannot move
 * a spend total.
