/**
 * Reconciliation readiness has to reach the GUI, not just the terminal.
 *
 * On the owner's real ledger every OpenAI row arrived by native import, so a
 * reconciliation would match $0 of the imported OpenAI spend. The CLI says so, at length, before
 * the credential step — minting an OpenAI Admin key is a real permission
 * decision, and discovering afterwards that nothing would have counted is
 * discovering it too late.
 *
 * The dashboard could not say it at all. `/api/billing` carries
 * `directOpenAiCosts.coverage`, which is the POST-observation partition and is
 * `null` until a provider snapshot exists — so on the exact ledger the warning
 * was written for, the GUI's only readiness affordance was a card telling you
 * to go and run a CLI command. That leaves the primary surface silent about a
 * limit the product's own rules require it to state in the same place as the
 * result.
 *
 * Two things are pinned here:
 *
 *   1. The readiness computation is SHARED, not reimplemented per surface. The
 *      CLI and the API must return the same object for the same store. This
 *      repository has already shipped one defect of exactly the opposite shape
 *      — a GUI declaration that disagreed with the wire — and two hand-written
 *      copies of a rule drift the same way.
 *   2. The wire actually carries it, with the shape the GUI declares. Checked
 *      against a real response, not against another declaration.
