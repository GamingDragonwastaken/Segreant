/**
 * The dashboard's ROUTE TABLE, tested as a table.
 *
 * Route matching and route handling used to be one 560-line if-chain inside
 * `createDashboardServer`. Two properties that matter got harder to see the
 * longer it grew:
 *
 *   - which methods each path answers, and with which `Allow` header, and
 *   - which paths are gated behind `x-segreant-local: 1` — the CSRF guard that is
 *     the only thing stopping a page you visit from driving your local Segreant.
 *
 * Both were spelled out per-branch, so "is every mutating route guarded?" could
 * only be answered by reading all of them and trusting that you had not missed
 * one. They are declarations now (`src/dashboard/routes.ts`), which means they
 * can be asserted directly rather than probed endpoint by endpoint.
 *
 * This file checks the declarations against the wire in both directions: the
 * table says what the server does, and the server does what the table says.
