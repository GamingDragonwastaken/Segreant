# Segreant brand assets

## Identity mark

A gold griffin segreant (rearing) on sable. Its wing is four stepped, rising
bars: flight feathers that also read as a bar chart, because the product is a
ledger for AI spend.

The concept was generated with an image-generation model over three rounds of
briefs. The chosen study was reduced to a two-tone mask, smoothed, traced to
vector paths with potracer, and recoloured to the exact palette. Every file
below comes from that one trace. None of them contains a generated raster,
gradient, texture or live text.

- `mark.svg` is the ringed mark; `mark-plain.svg` is the griffin without the ring.
- `mark-{16,32,64,180,256,512}.png` and `mark-plain-{16,32,64,180,256,512}.png`
  are raster sizes. At 16 px, the ring is dropped: both files are the plain
  griffin, since a ring at that size swallows the figure.
- `mark-simple-16.svg` / `.png` is the 16 px favicon: a box-filtered reduction
  of the same trace, not a second drawing.
- `lockup.svg` is the ringed mark and the word Segreant. The lettering is
  Fraunces at weight 600, converted to paths; no font file is needed.

## Web and social images

- `hero-1920.jpg` is the website hero: a generated ledger-grid background with
  the traced mark placed on it at half opacity.
- `social-card.png` (1280 x 640) and `social-card-1600.jpg` (1600 x 800) are captures
  of the website hero itself (dark theme, after the opening print run), rendered
  in headless Chrome from `web/index.html` with its `?card` capture flag, so the
  card always shows the site as it is.

The Warden pixel sprite is still in design and is not shipped yet.

Palette: Sable `#0B0D14`, Or `#E8B33C`, shadow gold `#A9791C`, within budget
`#63C593`, guarding `#E25D4A`, and unknown `#6C7385`.
